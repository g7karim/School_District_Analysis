Summary Analysis

PURPOSE:

I am assisting Maria to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs as the school board reported academic dishonesty. Maria as well requested to repeat the school district analysis from the module and describe how these changes affected the overall analysis in a written report. The following analysis will be looking in the comparisons between the original analysis and the new analysis.

RESULTS: 

A) How is the district summary affected?

B) How is the school summary affected?

C) How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

- There is a significant drop in Thomas High School's scores; it dropped from 4th to 7th highest scores in the district

SUMMARY
The four major changes that occurred between the two analyses were:

- When removing the 9th graders' scores, Thomas High School is no longer ranked as the highest scoring school compared to other charter schools.
- When excluding the Thomas High School, the overall 9th graders' scores dropped.
- When removing the grade 9 scores, the district summary decreases 
- While grade 9 students at Thomas High School are no longer the highest performers, the grade 10th-12th balance out the school's scores.
